            <p> Hello, I'm Lyle (He/Him/His) I am a 25 year old man, Gen-Z, AAPI, who is looking forward to this opportunity to grow and develop my career as an aspiring data leader, social worker, and health & wellness + tech professional. I graduated from the university of washington year 2020 (COVID year yuck), majored in medical anthropology and minored in environmental science, but have always been tech savvy/has had a passion for tech growing up. Why I'm doing Coding Temple now is because of chance of luck. Long story semi-short, I lost my new job and by the grace of God this opportunity came up literally when I found out I lost my job and was on the computer looking/applying for new jobs. I'm a firm believer of "everything happens for a reason" because it led me to here. I never really considered boot camps before because of the price point and the impression of "why am i doing this now even though I could have majored in STEM back in college", but I realize that opportunities like this are always timely and I feel like the right time always hits when the hit is needed, whether it's a sucker punch or a light tap to guide you on the right path. All of what has been accumulating in my life so far has led me to here, so I'm dreaming to keep going on this journey. I'm appreciative and am looking forward to grow for the reasons I care about</p>
